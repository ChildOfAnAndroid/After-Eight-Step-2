INITIAL NOTES


After Eight Step 2.0

Charis Cat // Child of an Android 2021

I am re-writing the After Eight Step to work independently of Max, so that 
it works without being plugged in and is also 100% free. 


I am also adding CV control to enable use of the after eight step in my 
DIY modular synth setup. 


I am removing the screen and some other elements as they didn't add anything,
allowing room for the CV gates.
